2025-05-23 00:29:08,685 - DEBUG - Gemini explanation: ['1. Parking Violation Definition: In this smart parking system context, a parking violation means that a vehicle has parked in a space and violated one or more rules defined by the system, such as exceeding the allotted parking time, failing to pay the required fee, parking in a reserved space without authorization, or parking a vehicle of an unauthorized type/size.', '2. How Feature Values Suggest No Violation:', 'Sensor Reading Pressure (5.0) and Vehicle Type Weight (5.0):  These values likely represent a standardized unit where 5.0 indicates a vehicle is correctly parked and occupies the space as expected. A significant deviation from this value (e.g., much lower, suggesting no vehicle, or much higher, suggesting an oversized vehicle) would indicate a potential problem.', 'User Type: Visitor:  Visitors are often allowed specific parking privileges, such as a time-limited stay.  This suggests the system recognizes the parking session is within its acceptable parameters.', 'Payment Status: Paid: This is a clear indication that the required fee has been paid for the parking duration.']
